4. Use **US Stock Analysis** to validate fundamental thesis before deploying capital
5. Review Greeks and P/L scenarios to select optimal strategy (covered calls, spreads, straddles, etc.)

### Portfolio Review & Rebalancing
1. Use **Portfolio Manager** to fetch current holdings via Alpaca MCP and analyze portfolio health
2. Review asset allocation, sector diversification, and risk metrics (beta, volatility, concentration)
3. Evaluate position-level recommendations (HOLD/ADD/TRIM/SELL) based on thesis validation
4. Use **Market Environment Analysis** and **US Market Bubble Detector** to assess macro conditions
5. Execute rebalancing plan with specific buy/sell actions to optimize allocation

### Statistical Arbitrage Opportunities
1. Use **Pair Trade Screener** to identify cointegrated stock pairs within sectors
2. Analyze mean-reversion metrics (half-life, z-score) and hedge ratios
3. Use **Technical Analyst** to confirm technical setups for both legs of the pair
4. Monitor entry/exit signals based on z-score thresholds
5. Track spread convergence and manage market-neutral positions

### Skill Quality & Automation

- **Data Quality Checker** (`data-quality-checker`)
  - Validates data quality in market analysis documents and blog articles before publication.
  - 5 check categories: price scale inconsistencies (ETF vs futures digit hints), instrument notation consistency, date/weekday mismatches (English + Japanese), allocation total errors (section-limited), and unit mismatches.
  - Advisory mode — flags issues as warnings for human review, exit 0 even with findings.
  - Supports full-width Japanese characters (％, 〜), range notation (50-55%), and year inference for dates without explicit year.
  - No API key required — works offline on local markdown files.

- **Skill Designer** (`skill-designer`)
  - Generates Claude CLI prompts for designing new skills from structured idea specifications.
  - Embeds repository conventions (structure guide, quality checklist, SKILL.md template) into the prompt.
  - Lists existing skills to prevent duplication. Used by the skill auto-generation pipeline's daily flow.
  - No API key required.

- **Dual-Axis Skill Reviewer** (`dual-axis-skill-reviewer`)
  - Reviews skill quality using a dual-axis method: deterministic auto scoring (structure, workflow, execution safety, artifacts, tests) and optional LLM deep review.
  - 5-category auto axis (0-100): Metadata & Use Case (20), Workflow Coverage (25), Execution Safety & Reproducibility (25), Supporting Artifacts (10), Test Health (20).
  - Detects `knowledge_only` skills (no scripts, references only) and adjusts scoring expectations to avoid unfair penalties.
  - Optional LLM axis for qualitative review (correctness, risk, missing logic, maintainability) with configurable weight blending.
  - Supports `--all` flag to review every skill at once, `--skip-tests` for quick triage, and `--project-root` for cross-project review.
  - No API key required.

- **Skill Idea Miner** (`skill-idea-miner`)
  - Mines Claude Code session logs for skill idea candidates, scores them for novelty/feasibility/trading value, and maintains a prioritized backlog.
  - Used by the weekly skill auto-generation pipeline. Can also be run manually.
  - No API key required.

## Skill Self-Improvement Loop

An automated pipeline that continuously reviews and improves skill quality. A daily `launchd` job picks one skill, scores it with the dual-axis reviewer, and if the score is below 90/100, invokes `claude -p` to apply improvements and open a PR.

### How It Works

1. **Round-robin selection** — cycles through all skills (excluding the reviewer itself), persisted in `logs/.skill_improvement_state.json`.
2. **Auto scoring** — runs `run_dual_axis_review.py` to get a deterministic score (0-100).
3. **Improvement gate** — if `auto_review.score < 90`, Claude CLI applies fixes to SKILL.md and references.
4. **Quality gate** — re-scores after improvement (with tests enabled); rolls back if the score didn't improve.
5. **PR creation** — commits changes to a feature branch and opens a GitHub PR for human review.
6. **Daily summary** — writes results to `reports/skill-improvement-log/YYYY-MM-DD_summary.md`.

### Manual Execution

```bash
# Dry-run: score one skill without applying improvements or creating PRs
python3 scripts/run_skill_improvement_loop.py --dry-run

# Review all skills in dry-run mode
python3 scripts/run_skill_improvement_loop.py --dry-run --all

# Full run: score, improve if needed, and open PR
python3 scripts/run_skill_improvement_loop.py
```

### launchd Setup (macOS)

The loop runs daily at 05:00 local time via macOS `launchd`:

```bash
# Install the agent
cp launchd/com.trade-analysis.skill-improvement.plist ~/Library/LaunchAgents/
launchctl load ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.trade-analysis.skill-improvement.plist

# Verify
launchctl list | grep skill-improvement

# Manual trigger
launchctl start com.trade-analysis.skill-improvement
```

### Key Files

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `scripts/run_skill_improvement_loop.py` | Orchestration script (selection, scoring, improvement, PR) |
| `scripts/run_skill_improvement.sh` | Thin shell wrapper for launchd |
| `launchd/com.trade-analysis.skill-improvement.plist` | macOS launchd agent configuration |
| `skills/dual-axis-skill-reviewer/` | Reviewer skill (scoring engine) |
| `logs/.skill_improvement_state.json` | Round-robin state and history |
| `reports/skill-improvement-log/` | Daily summary reports |

## Skill Auto-Generation Pipeline

An automated pipeline that mines session logs for skill ideas (weekly) and designs, reviews, and creates new skills as PRs (daily). Works alongside the Self-Improvement Loop to continuously expand the skill catalog.

### How It Works

1. **Weekly mining** — scans Claude Code session logs for recurring patterns that could become skills, scores each idea for novelty, feasibility, and trading value.
2. **Backlog scoring** — ranked ideas are stored in `logs/.skill_generation_backlog.yaml` with status tracking (`pending`, `in_progress`, `completed`, `design_failed`, `review_failed`, `pr_failed`).
3. **Daily selection** — picks the highest-scoring `pending` idea; retries `design_failed` / `pr_failed` once (but `review_failed` is terminal).
4. **Design & review** — the Skill Designer builds a complete skill (SKILL.md, references, scripts), then the Dual-Axis Reviewer scores it. If the score is too low, the idea is marked `review_failed`.
5. **PR creation** — commits the new skill to a feature branch and opens a GitHub PR for human review.

### Manual Execution

```bash
# Weekly: mine ideas from session logs and score them
python3 scripts/run_skill_generation_pipeline.py --mode weekly --dry-run

# Daily: design a skill from the highest-scoring backlog idea
python3 scripts/run_skill_generation_pipeline.py --mode daily --dry-run

# Full daily run (creates branch, designs skill, opens PR)
python3 scripts/run_skill_generation_pipeline.py --mode daily
```

### launchd Setup (macOS)

Two `launchd` agents handle the weekly and daily schedules:

```bash
# Install both agents
cp launchd/com.trade-analysis.skill-generation-weekly.plist ~/Library/LaunchAgents/
cp launchd/com.trade-analysis.skill-generation-daily.plist ~/Library/LaunchAgents/
launchctl load ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.trade-analysis.skill-generation-weekly.plist
launchctl load ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.trade-analysis.skill-generation-daily.plist

# Verify
launchctl list | grep skill-generation

# Manual trigger
launchctl start com.trade-analysis.skill-generation-weekly
launchctl start com.trade-analysis.skill-generation-daily
```

### Key Files

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `scripts/run_skill_generation_pipeline.py` | Orchestration script (mining, selection, design, review, PR) |
| `scripts/run_skill_generation.sh` | Thin shell wrapper for launchd |
| `launchd/com.trade-analysis.skill-generation-weekly.plist` | Weekly mining schedule (Saturday 06:00) |
| `launchd/com.trade-analysis.skill-generation-daily.plist` | Daily generation schedule (07:00) |
| `skills/skill-idea-miner/` | Mining and scoring skill |

| `logs/.skill_generation_backlog.yaml` | Scored idea backlog with status tracking |
| `logs/.skill_generation_state.json` | Run history and state |
| `reports/skill-generation-log/` | Daily generation summary reports |

## Customization & Contribution
- Update `SKILL.md` files to tweak trigger descriptions or capability notes; ensure the frontmatter name matches the folder name when zipping.
- Extend reference documents or add scripts inside each skill folder to support new workflows.
- When distributing updates, regenerate the matching `.skill` file in `skill-packages/` so web-app users get the latest version.
