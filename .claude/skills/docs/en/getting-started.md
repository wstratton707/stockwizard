## Your First Skill -- FinViz Screener

FinViz Screener is the easiest skill to try because it requires **no API key**. You describe screening criteria in natural language, and Claude builds a FinViz filter URL and opens the results in Chrome.

### Example Prompt

Tell Claude:

```
Find stocks with EPS growth > 25% and price above SMA200
```

### What Claude Does

1. **Parses** your natural language and maps it to FinViz filter codes:
   - `fa_epsqoq_o25` (Quarterly EPS growth > 25%)
   - `ta_sma200_pa` (Price above SMA200)
2. **Presents** the selected filters in a table for your confirmation.
3. **Builds** the URL and opens the FinViz screener results page in Chrome.

### Expected Output

- Chrome opens with the FinViz Screener results matching your criteria.
- Stocks are displayed in a sortable table.
- Switch between Overview, Valuation, Financial, and Technical views for deeper analysis.

> For advanced usage including Japanese input, programmatic mode, and 14+ pre-built recipes, see the [FinViz Screener Guide]({{ '/en/skills/finviz-screener/' | relative_url }}).

## Troubleshooting

### Skill Not Loading

| Cause | Fix |
|-------|-----|
| `name` field in SKILL.md does not match the folder name | Verify that `name` in the YAML frontmatter exactly matches the skill folder name |
| Skill folder placed in the wrong directory | Confirm the folder is inside Claude Code's Skills directory |
| Claude Code not restarted | Restart Claude Code after adding a new skill |

### API Key Errors

```
ERROR: FMP API key not found. Set FMP_API_KEY environment variable or use --api-key argument.
```

**Fix:**
1. Verify the environment variable is set: `echo $FMP_API_KEY`
2. Add `export FMP_API_KEY=your_key` to your shell config (`.zshrc` or `.bashrc`) and reload it
3. As a fallback, pass the key directly with `--api-key YOUR_KEY`

### Python Dependency Errors

```
ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'requests'
```

**Fix:**

```bash
pip install requests beautifulsoup4 lxml pandas numpy yfinance
```

> Required dependencies vary by skill. Check the Prerequisites section in each skill's guide for specifics.
{: .note }

### FMP API Rate Limit

```
ERROR: 429 Too Many Requests - Rate limit exceeded
```

**Fix:**
1. The script automatically retries after 60 seconds.
2. If you hit the free tier limit (250 calls/day), it resets at midnight UTC.
3. Reduce the analysis scope with `--max-candidates` to lower API usage.
4. For frequent use, consider upgrading to FMP Starter ($29.99/mo, 750 calls/day).
