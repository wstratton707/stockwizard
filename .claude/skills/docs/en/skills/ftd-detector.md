# FTD Detector
{: .no_toc }

Detects Follow-Through Day (FTD) signals for market bottom confirmation using William O'Neil's methodology. Dual-index tracking (S&P 500 + NASDAQ) with state machine for rally attempt, FTD qualification, and post-FTD health monitoring. Use when user asks about market bottom signals, follow-through days, rally attempts, re-entry timing after corrections, or whether it's safe to increase equity exposure. Complementary to market-top-detector (defensive) - this skill is offensive (bottom confirmation).

## 1. Overview

FTD Detector identifies market bottom signals using William O'Neil's Follow-Through Day methodology. It tracks S&P 500 and NASDAQ/QQQ simultaneously through a state machine that progresses from correction to rally attempt to FTD confirmation, with post-FTD health monitoring including distribution day counting, invalidation detection, and power trend analysis.

---

## 2. When to Use

- User asks "Is the market bottoming?" or "Is it safe to buy again?"
- User observes a market correction (3%+ decline) and wants re-entry timing
- User asks about Follow-Through Days or rally attempts
- User wants to assess if a recent bounce is sustainable
- User asks about increasing equity exposure after a correction
- Market Top Detector shows elevated risk and user wants bottom signals

---

## 3. Prerequisites

- **FMP API Key:** Required. Set `FMP_API_KEY` environment variable or pass via `--api-key` flag.
- **Python 3.8+:** With `requests` library installed.
- **API Budget:** 4 calls per execution (well within FMP free tier of 250/day).

---

## 4. Quick Start

```bash
python3 skills/ftd-detector/scripts/ftd_detector.py --api-key $FMP_API_KEY
```

---

## 5. Workflow

### Phase 1: Execute Python Script

Run the FTD detector script:

```bash
python3 skills/ftd-detector/scripts/ftd_detector.py --api-key $FMP_API_KEY
```

The script will:
1. Fetch S&P 500 and QQQ historical data (60+ trading days) from FMP API
2. Fetch current quotes for both indices
3. Run dual-index state machine (correction → rally → FTD detection)
4. Assess post-FTD health (distribution days, invalidation, power trend)
5. Calculate quality score (0-100)
6. Generate JSON and Markdown reports

**API Budget:** 4 calls (well within free tier of 250/day)

### Phase 2: Present Results

Present the generated Markdown report to the user, highlighting:
- Current market state (correction, rally attempt, FTD confirmed, etc.)
- Quality score and signal strength
- Recommended exposure level
- Key watch levels (swing low, FTD day low)
- Post-FTD health (distribution days, power trend)

### Phase 3: Contextual Guidance

Based on the market state, provide additional guidance:

**If FTD Confirmed (score 60+):**
- Suggest looking at leading stocks in proper bases
- Reference CANSLIM screener for candidate stocks
- Remind about position sizing and stops

**If Rally Attempt (Day 1-3):**
- Advise patience, do not buy ahead of FTD
- Suggest building watchlists

**If No Correction:**
- FTD analysis is not applicable in uptrend
- Redirect to Market Top Detector for defensive signals
