## 1. Overview

Create an abstraction layer between detection and strategy implementation.
This skill clusters ticket evidence, summarizes recurring conditions, and outputs `edge_concepts.yaml` with explicit thesis and invalidation logic.

---

## 2. When to Use

- You have many raw tickets and need mechanism-level structure.
- You want to avoid direct ticket-to-strategy overfitting.
- You need concept-level review before strategy drafting.

---

## 3. Prerequisites

- Python 3.9+
- `PyYAML`
- Ticket YAML directory from detector output (`tickets/exportable`, `tickets/research_only`)
- Optional `hints.yaml`

---

## 4. Quick Start

1. Collect ticket YAML files from auto-detection output.
2. Optionally provide `hints.yaml` for context matching.
3. Run `scripts/synthesize_edge_concepts.py`.
4. Deduplicate concepts: merge same-hypothesis concepts with overlapping conditions (containment > threshold).
5. Review concepts and promote only high-support concepts into strategy drafting.
