## 1. Overview

Translate concept-level hypotheses into concrete strategy draft specs.
This skill sits after concept synthesis and before pipeline export validation.

---

## 2. When to Use

- You have `edge_concepts.yaml` and need strategy candidates.
- You want multiple variants (core/conservative/research-probe) per concept.
- You want optional exportable ticket files for interface v1 families.

---

## 3. Prerequisites

- Python 3.9+
- `PyYAML`
- `edge_concepts.yaml` produced by concept synthesis

---

## 4. Quick Start

1. Load `edge_concepts.yaml`.
2. Choose risk profile (`conservative`, `balanced`, `aggressive`).
3. Generate per-concept variants with hypothesis-type exit calibration.
4. Apply `HYPOTHESIS_EXIT_OVERRIDES` to adjust stop-loss, reward-to-risk, time-stop, and trailing-stop per hypothesis type (breakout, earnings_drift, panic_reversal, etc.).
5. Clamp reward-to-risk at `RR_FLOOR=1.5` to prevent C5 review failures.
6. Export v1-ready ticket YAML when applicable.
7. Hand off exportable tickets to `skills/edge-candidate-agent/scripts/export_candidate.py`.
