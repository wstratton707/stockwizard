## 1. Overview

The CANSLIM Screener applies William O'Neil's growth stock selection system -- developed from studying every major stock winner from 1953 to the present. The methodology identifies 7 common traits that multi-bagger stocks exhibit before their major price advances.

**What it solves:**
- Systematically scores stocks across the 7 CANSLIM dimensions instead of relying on subjective judgment
- Provides composite ratings (0-100) with clear interpretation bands
- Protects against buying in bear markets (M component gates all recommendations)
- Automates the labor-intensive process of analyzing earnings, growth, momentum, institutional activity, and market conditions

**Phase 3 implements all 7 components:**

| Component | Weight | What It Measures |
|-----------|--------|-----------------|
| **C** - Current Earnings | 15% | Quarterly EPS and revenue growth (YoY) |
| **A** - Annual Growth | 20% | 3-year EPS CAGR and stability |
| **N** - Newness | 15% | Distance from 52-week high, breakout detection |
| **S** - Supply/Demand | 15% | Volume-based accumulation/distribution |
| **L** - Leadership | 20% | 52-week relative strength vs S&P 500 |
| **I** - Institutional | 10% | Holder count + ownership % (with Finviz fallback) |
| **M** - Market Direction | 5% | S&P 500 trend vs 50-day EMA |

## 2. Prerequisites

> FMP API key is required. The free tier (250 calls/day) supports up to 35 stocks per run. Use `--max-candidates 35` to stay within the limit.
{: .api_required }

**API Requirements:**
- **FMP API key** -- Free tier: 250 calls/day. Starter tier ($29.99/mo): 750 calls/day for full 40-stock screening.
- Sign up: [https://site.financialmodelingprep.com/developer/docs](https://site.financialmodelingprep.com/developer/docs)

**Python Dependencies:**
- Python 3.7+
- `requests` (FMP API calls)
- `beautifulsoup4` (Finviz web scraping for I component fallback)
- `lxml` (HTML parsing)

```bash
pip install requests beautifulsoup4 lxml
```

**API Budget (Phase 3):**
- 40 stocks x 7 FMP calls/stock = 280 FMP calls
- Market data (S&P 500 quote, VIX, 52-week history): 3 calls
- Total: ~283 FMP calls per run (exceeds 250 free tier)
- **Recommendation:** Use `--max-candidates 35` for free tier (248 calls), or upgrade to Starter

---

## 3. Quick Start

```bash
# Set your API key
export FMP_API_KEY=your_key_here

# Run with default S&P 500 universe (top 40 by market cap)
python3 skills/canslim-screener/scripts/screen_canslim.py --output-dir reports/

# Free tier optimization (35 stocks max)
python3 skills/canslim-screener/scripts/screen_canslim.py \
  --max-candidates 35 --output-dir reports/
```

Or simply tell Claude:

```
Run a CANSLIM screen on the top 35 S&P 500 stocks
```

---

## 4. How It Works

The screener operates in a two-stage pipeline:

**Stage 1 -- Data Collection & Scoring (FMP API + Finviz):**
1. Fetch S&P 500 historical data for M component (market direction) and L component (relative strength benchmark)
2. For each stock, make 7 FMP API calls: profile, quote, income statement (2 periods), 90-day history, 365-day history, institutional holders
3. Calculate all 7 component scores using dedicated calculator modules
4. When FMP institutional data is incomplete, automatically fall back to Finviz web scraping for ownership percentage

**Stage 2 -- Ranking & Reporting:**
1. Calculate composite weighted score: C(15%) + A(20%) + N(15%) + S(15%) + L(20%) + I(10%) + M(5%)
2. Rank all stocks by composite score (highest first)
3. Generate JSON output for programmatic use and Markdown report for human review

**Finviz fallback behavior:**
- Triggers automatically when FMP `sharesOutstanding` is unavailable
- Scrapes institutional ownership % from Finviz.com (free, no API key needed)
- Rate-limited at 2.0 seconds per request
- Improves I component accuracy from 35/100 (partial data) to 60-100/100 (full data)

## 5. Usage Examples

### Example 1: Default S&P 500 Screening

**Prompt:**
```
Screen the S&P 500 for CANSLIM stocks
```

**What happens:** Claude runs the screener against the default universe of 40 stocks (top S&P 500 by market cap). Takes approximately 2 minutes. Generates a ranked report with composite scores and component breakdowns.

**Why useful:** The quickest way to identify the strongest growth stocks in the large-cap universe using a proven methodology.

---

### Example 2: Semiconductor Sector Focus

**Command:**
```bash
python3 skills/canslim-screener/scripts/screen_canslim.py \
  --universe NVDA AMD QCOM AVGO TXN INTC MU MRVL AMAT LRCX \
  --output-dir reports/
```

**Why useful:** Narrows the analysis to a single high-growth sector. Useful when you already have a sector thesis and want to rank the best candidates within it using CANSLIM criteria.

---

### Example 3: Free Tier Optimization

**Command:**
```bash
python3 skills/canslim-screener/scripts/screen_canslim.py \
  --max-candidates 35 --top 10 --output-dir reports/
```

**Why useful:** Stays within the FMP free tier limit (250 calls/day) while still analyzing a meaningful universe. The `--top 10` flag keeps the report focused on the strongest candidates.

---

### Example 4: Component Deep Dive

After running a screen, examine the component breakdown for a top-scoring stock:

```
Score: 92.3 / 100 (Exceptional+)
  C (Current Earnings): 100/100 - EPS +58% QoQ, Revenue +32%
  A (Annual Growth):     95/100 - 3yr EPS CAGR 42%, consistent growth
  N (Newness):           98/100 - Within 2% of 52-week high, volume breakout
  S (Supply/Demand):     85/100 - Up/Down Volume Ratio 1.65 (Accumulation)
  L (Leadership):        92/100 - 52wk: +45% (+22% vs S&P 500), RS 88
  I (Institutional):     90/100 - 6,199 holders, 68.3% ownership
  M (Market Direction): 100/100 - Strong uptrend, S&P above 50-day EMA
```

**Why useful:** Understanding which components drive the score helps you assess whether the stock's strength is broad-based or concentrated in one area. Stocks with high scores across all components are the most reliable.

---

### Example 5: Bear Market Scenario

When the M component detects a bear market (S&P 500 below 50-day EMA, VIX elevated):

```
Market Condition: BEAR MARKET DETECTED
M Score: 0/100

WARNING: CANSLIM methodology recommends raising 80-100% cash in bear markets.
3 out of 4 stocks follow the market trend. Do NOT initiate new positions.
```

**Why useful:** The M component acts as a circuit breaker. Even if individual stocks score 90+ on other components, CANSLIM's historical data shows that buying in confirmed bear markets has a poor win rate. This protects capital.

---

### Example 6: Interpreting Score Ranges

| Rating | Score | Guidance | Position Sizing |
|--------|-------|----------|----------------|
| Exceptional+ | 90-100 | All components near-perfect. Aggressive buy | 15-20% of portfolio |
| Exceptional | 80-89 | Outstanding fundamentals + momentum. Strong buy | 10-15% of portfolio |
| Strong | 70-79 | Solid across components, minor weaknesses. Standard buy | 8-12% of portfolio |
| Above Average | 60-69 | Meets thresholds with one weak component. Buy on pullback | 5-8% of portfolio |

**Why useful:** The interpretation bands translate abstract scores into concrete position sizing guidance, aligning risk exposure with conviction level.

---

## 6. Understanding the Output

The screener generates two files:
- `canslim_screener_YYYY-MM-DD_HHMMSS.json` -- Structured data for programmatic use
- `canslim_screener_YYYY-MM-DD_HHMMSS.md` -- Human-readable report

**Report sections:**
1. **Market Condition Summary** -- Current trend, M score, and warnings
2. **Top N CANSLIM Candidates** -- Ranked by composite score with:
   - Composite score and rating band
   - Individual component scores with explanatory details
   - Data source notes (e.g., "Institutional data from Finviz")
   - Weakest component identification
3. **Summary Statistics** -- Distribution of ratings (how many Exceptional+, Exceptional, Strong, etc.)
4. **Methodology Note** -- Phase 3: 7 components, 100% coverage

**Quality warnings to watch for:**
- "Revenue declining despite EPS growth" -- Possible buyback distortion
- "Using Finviz institutional ownership data" -- Data source switched (still accurate)
- "Bear market detected" -- M component = 0, do not buy

---

## 7. Tips & Best Practices

- **Always check the M component first.** If M = 0, the rest of the scores are irrelevant from a CANSLIM perspective. Raise cash and wait.
- **Look for broad strength.** A score of 85 with all components above 70 is more reliable than a score of 85 with one component at 100 and another at 40.
- **Use `--max-candidates 35` for free tier.** This is the sweet spot for the 250 calls/day FMP free tier limit.
- **Run weekly, not daily.** CANSLIM is a weekly screening methodology. Earnings data updates quarterly, and most components are stable week-to-week.
- **Cross-reference with charts.** CANSLIM identifies fundamentally strong stocks, but entry timing matters. Use the Technical Analyst skill for chart-based entry confirmation.
- **Finviz fallback is reliable.** Testing showed 100% success rate (39/39 stocks) with ~2.5 seconds per request. The data quality is equivalent to FMP.

## 8. Combining with Other Skills

| Workflow | Steps |
|----------|-------|
| **Full growth stock pipeline** | CANSLIM Screener (rank candidates) > Technical Analyst (confirm chart setup) > Position Sizer (calculate shares) |
| **CANSLIM + VCP** | Run CANSLIM to identify growth leaders, then check if top candidates also show VCP patterns via VCP Screener |
| **Pre-filter with FinViz** | Use FinViz Screener (`fa_epsqoq_o25,ta_sma200_pa,ta_highlow52w_b0to10h`) to build a custom universe, then pass those tickers to CANSLIM Screener with `--universe` |
| **Earnings confirmation** | After CANSLIM ranks candidates, check Earnings Calendar for upcoming report dates to avoid entering before volatile events |
| **Bear market protection** | When CANSLIM M = 0, switch to Market Environment Analysis and Breadth Chart Analyst to monitor for recovery signals |

---

## 9. Troubleshooting

### FMP API rate limit exceeded (429 error)

The script automatically retries after 60 seconds. If the error persists:
- Reduce the universe: `--max-candidates 30`
- Check daily usage: free tier resets at midnight UTC
- Upgrade to FMP Starter ($29.99/mo) for 750 calls/day

### Missing Python libraries

```
ERROR: required libraries not found. Install with: pip install beautifulsoup4 requests lxml
```

Install all dependencies:
```bash
pip install requests beautifulsoup4 lxml
```

### Finviz web scraping failure (403 error)

This occurs when Finviz blocks scraping requests. The script degrades gracefully:
- Falls back to FMP holder count only
- I component score is capped at 70/100 with a 50% penalty
- Wait a few minutes and retry, or verify your network access to finviz.com

### All stocks scoring below 60

This may indicate bear market conditions or a universe lacking growth stocks:
- Check the M component -- if M = 0, follow bear market protocol (raise cash)
- Try a different sector or expand the universe
- In weak markets, scores in the 55-65 range may still be the relative best available
