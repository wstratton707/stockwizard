# Stanley Druckenmiller Investment
{: .no_toc }

Druckenmiller Strategy Synthesizer - Integrates 8 upstream skill outputs (Market Breadth, Uptrend Analysis, Market Top, Macro Regime, FTD Detector, VCP Screener, Theme Detector, CANSLIM Screener) into a unified conviction score (0-100), pattern classification, and allocation recommendation. Use when user asks about overall market conviction, portfolio positioning, asset allocation, strategy synthesis, or Druckenmiller-style analysis. Triggers on queries like "What is my conviction level?", "How should I position?", "Run the strategy synthesizer", "Druckenmiller analysis".

## 1. Overview

# Druckenmiller Strategy Synthesizer

---

## 2. When to Use

**English:**
- User asks "What's my overall conviction?" or "How should I be positioned?"
- User wants a unified view synthesizing breadth, uptrend, top risk, macro, and FTD signals
- User asks about Druckenmiller-style portfolio positioning
- User requests strategy synthesis after running individual analysis skills
- User asks "Should I increase or decrease exposure?"
- User wants pattern classification (policy pivot, distortion, contrarian, wait)


---

## 3. Prerequisites

- **API Key:** None required
- **Python 3.9+** recommended

---

## 4. Quick Start

```bash
python3 skills/stanley-druckenmiller-investment/scripts/strategy_synthesizer.py \
  --reports-dir reports/ \
  --output-dir reports/ \
  --max-age 72
```

---

## 5. Workflow

### Phase 1: Verify Prerequisites

Check that the 5 required skill JSON reports exist in `reports/` and are recent (< 72 hours). If any are missing, run the corresponding skill first.

### Phase 2: Execute Strategy Synthesizer

```bash
python3 skills/stanley-druckenmiller-investment/scripts/strategy_synthesizer.py \
  --reports-dir reports/ \
  --output-dir reports/ \
  --max-age 72
```

The script will:
1. Load and validate all upstream skill JSON reports
2. Extract normalized signals from each skill
3. Calculate 7 component scores (weighted 0-100)
4. Compute composite conviction score
5. Classify into one of 4 Druckenmiller patterns
6. Generate target allocation and position sizing
7. Output JSON and Markdown reports

### Phase 3: Present Results

Present the generated Markdown report, highlighting:
- Conviction score and zone
- Detected pattern and match strength
- Strongest and weakest components
- Target allocation (equity/bonds/alternatives/cash)
- Position sizing parameters
- Relevant Druckenmiller principle

### Phase 4: Provide Druckenmiller Context

Load appropriate reference documents to provide philosophical context:
- **High conviction:** Emphasize concentration and "fat pitch" principles
- **Low conviction:** Emphasize capital preservation and patience
- **Pattern-specific:** Apply relevant case study from `references/case-studies.md`
