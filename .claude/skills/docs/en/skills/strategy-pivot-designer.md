## 1. Overview

Detect when a strategy's backtest iteration loop has stalled and propose structurally different strategy architectures. This skill acts as the feedback loop for the Edge pipeline (hint-extractor -> concept-synthesizer -> strategy-designer -> candidate-agent), breaking out of local optima by redesigning the strategy's skeleton rather than tweaking parameters.

---

## 2. When to Use

- Backtest scores have plateaued despite multiple refinement iterations.
- A strategy shows signs of overfitting (high in-sample, low robustness).
- Transaction costs defeat the strategy's thin edge.
- Tail risk or drawdown exceeds acceptable thresholds.
- You want to explore fundamentally different strategy architectures for the same market hypothesis.

---

## 3. Prerequisites

- Python 3.9+
- `PyYAML`
- Iteration history JSON (accumulated backtest-expert evaluations)
- Source strategy draft YAML (from edge-strategy-designer)

---

## 4. Quick Start

1. Accumulate backtest evaluation results into an iteration history file using `--append-eval`.
2. Run stagnation detection on the history to identify triggers (plateau, overfitting, cost defeat, tail risk).
3. If stagnation detected, generate pivot proposals using three techniques: assumption inversion, archetype switch, objective reframe.
4. Review ranked proposals (scored by quality potential + novelty).
5. For exportable proposals, ticket YAML is ready for edge-candidate-agent pipeline.
6. For research_only proposals, manual strategy design needed before pipeline integration.
7. Feed the selected pivot draft back into backtest-expert for the next iteration cycle.
