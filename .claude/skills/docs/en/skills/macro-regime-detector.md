# Macro Regime Detector
{: .no_toc }

Detect structural macro regime transitions (1-2 year horizon) using cross-asset ratio analysis. Analyze RSP/SPY concentration, yield curve, credit conditions, size factor, equity-bond relationship, and sector rotation to identify regime shifts between Concentration, Broadening, Contraction, Inflationary, and Transitional states. Run when user asks about macro regime, market regime change, structural rotation, or long-term market positioning.

## 1. Overview

# Macro Regime Detector

---

## 2. When to Use

- User asks about current macro regime or regime transitions
- User wants to understand structural market rotations (concentration vs broadening)
- User asks about long-term positioning based on yield curve, credit, or cross-asset signals
- User references RSP/SPY ratio, IWM/SPY, HYG/LQD, or other cross-asset ratios
- User wants to assess whether a regime change is underway

---

## 3. Prerequisites

- **FMP API Key** (required): Set `FMP_API_KEY` environment variable or pass `--api-key`
- Free tier (250 calls/day) is sufficient (script uses ~10 calls)

---

## 4. Quick Start

```bash
python3 skills/macro-regime-detector/scripts/macro_regime_detector.py
```

---

## 5. Workflow

1. Load reference documents for methodology context:
   - `references/regime_detection_methodology.md`
   - `references/indicator_interpretation_guide.md`

2. Execute the main analysis script:
   ```bash
   python3 skills/macro-regime-detector/scripts/macro_regime_detector.py
   ```
   This fetches 600 days of data for 9 ETFs + Treasury rates (10 API calls total).

3. Read the generated Markdown report and present findings to user.

4. Provide additional context using `references/historical_regimes.md` when user asks about historical parallels.

## 6. Components

| # | Component | Ratio/Data | Weight | What It Detects |
|---|-----------|------------|--------|-----------------|
| 1 | Market Concentration | RSP/SPY | 25% | Mega-cap concentration vs market broadening |
| 2 | Yield Curve | 10Y-2Y spread | 20% | Interest rate cycle transitions |
| 3 | Credit Conditions | HYG/LQD | 15% | Credit cycle risk appetite |
| 4 | Size Factor | IWM/SPY | 15% | Small vs large cap rotation |
| 5 | Equity-Bond | SPY/TLT + correlation | 15% | Stock-bond relationship regime |
| 6 | Sector Rotation | XLY/XLP | 10% | Cyclical vs defensive appetite |

---

## 7. Regime Classifications

- **Concentration**: Mega-cap leadership, narrow market. Focus on large-cap tech/growth leaders.
- **Broadening**: Expanding participation, small-cap/value rotation. Add equal-weight and cyclical exposure.
- **Contraction**: Credit tightening, defensive rotation, risk-off. Raise cash, prioritize Staples/Healthcare.
- **Inflationary**: Positive stock-bond correlation, traditional hedging fails. Real assets, TIPS, short-duration bonds.
- **Transitional**: Multiple signals but unclear pattern. Increase diversification, avoid concentrated bets.

## 8. Output

Two files are saved to `--output-dir` (default: current directory):

- `macro_regime_YYYY-MM-DD_HHMMSS.json` — Structured data for programmatic use
- `macro_regime_YYYY-MM-DD_HHMMSS.md` — Human-readable report with:
  1. Current Regime Assessment
  2. Transition Signal Dashboard
  3. Component Details
  4. Regime Classification Evidence
  5. Portfolio Posture Recommendations
